A message from TopCoder.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for engaging the TopCoder Copilots.  Your Copilot Opportunity will be posted to the TopCoder Community at the start time you scheduled, or within the next few minutes if you chose the option to post it immediately.  Once the Copilot Opportunity is posted, you can
expect to recieve email updates as the Copilot Opportunity progresses as well as when Copilots ask you questions in the forums.  The Copilots have 3 days to ask questions and submit their plans for your project.  After the competition submission phase is complete, you
will be able to review all of the Copilots and their submissions, and then choose one or more Copilots to manage your project.
