<p> 
Congratulations on being selected as the Copilot for "%PROJECT_NAME%" in the copilot posting "%COPILOT_POSTING_NAME%".  You have been granted access to the project and can access it <a href\='https\://www.topcoder.com/direct/projectOverview?formData.projectId\=%PROJECT_ID%'>here</a>.  On the Project Dashboard, you will find a <a href\='http\://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module\=Category&amp;categoryID\=%CATEGORY_ID%'>project forum</a> that you should use for private communication with the customer and their team.  Before going any further, please make sure you have read the <a href\='http\://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/x/FIXTAg'>Copilot How to Compete Guide</a>.
</p>

<p> 
Here is a summary of your next steps.  Please make sure you do step 1.  Steps 2 and 3 should be completed now too.  If you are unable to complete steps 2 and 3 yet, please let the customer know why in the project forum.
</p>

<p> 
1.  Post a message to your customer in the <a href\='http\://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module\=Category&amp;categoryID\=%CATEGORY_ID%'>Project Forum</a>.  This will let the customer know that you have been officially selected as the copilot and are ready to start.<br/>
2.  Create the game plan in <a href\='https\://www.topcoder.com/direct/dashboardActive.action'>Direct</a> by adding all known and estimated contests you plan to run.<br/>
3.  If it is not already set, please set the budget and expected duration for the project by using the <a href\='https\://www.topcoder.com/direct/editProject?formData.projectId\=%PROJECT_ID%'>Edit Project</a> screen.  This is very important, and many customers will not proceed with the project until they are set. This will help set expectations for the project.<br/>
4.  Communicate often and keep your game plans updated.  Your customer will appreciate it and be more likely to expand their relationship with you.
