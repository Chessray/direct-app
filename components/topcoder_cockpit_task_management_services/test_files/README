=================== enhancement ================
1. 
resolveTaskList(long userId, long taskListId) 

In this method, the designer's code:
oldTask = entityManager.find(...);

He finds the oldTask from the database, but this is not necessary, 
we only need to save the oldTaskStatus, which can be directly retrieve from the task.getStatus();


================= Steps to run the unit tests ==========

1. 
put spring, hiberate and other dependencies (the build-dependencies.xml may help) to your classpath.
2.
I have provided the mock_user_service.jar and the cockpit_modules.jar in reflib, 
add them to the class path too.
3. 
run create.sql in your database, make sure that delete all your existing tables before running the script.
4.
I use the devnullsmtp.jar (provided in test_files) as the smtp server.
use jar -jar devnullsmtp.jar to start the server before running the unit tests.
And you can save the receiving emails to a directory in the devnull stmp server to manully check the emails.
5.
Modifies the configurations for your own in:
a). test_files/jdbc.properties
b). test_files/com/topcoder/message/email/EmailEngine.xml

NOTE, I have success run my tests both in the spring 2.5.6 and hibernate 3.4(JPA1),
and also the spring 3.1 and hibernate 3.5.6 (JPA2).
But failed in spring 2.5.6 (JPA1) and hibernate 3.5.6(JPA2), you can try.
